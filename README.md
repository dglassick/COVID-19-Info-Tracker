# About
This project came about when the three group members were asked to make a real solution to a problem. The COVID shutdown had just happened and they thought it would be relevant to try and figure out a way to get information as quickly and as streamlined as possible. The app consists of an information page about COVID-19, how to stay healthy and safe, an API search that generates current numbers based on the country, an API call for the latest news headlines around COVID-19, and also a heat map that shows the amount of COVID-19 active, recovered, and the amount of deaths. The project utilized bootstrap as it's base CSS framework and then focused on creating a minimalistic approach to the layout.
